# This should start and run the test. The arguments are:
# 
# users: Number of concurrent users the test will simulate
# duration: For how many seconds the test will run
# baseUrl: Base path to the host providing the service weâ€™re testing. When we move over to Docker Swarm, the baseUrl will need to be changed to the public IP of the Swarm. More on that in part 5.
# After the test has finished, it writes results to the console windows as well as a fancy HTML report into target/gatling/results/.
